A simple Capybara/Poltergeist-PhantomJS example

This is a very basic setup to for being able to run tests on a headless browser (with PhantomJS), driven by Poltergeist and using Capybara.


The program will take a screenshot of the browser in the end of the execution, so that we can confirm it actually ran.
The default test will simply visit youtube and search for "Always look on the bright side of life"
